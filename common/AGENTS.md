# General Guidelines for Agents

- After checking README.md, MUST output "README checked!!".
- If a problem occurs, please avoid trying alternative solutions on your own. Check with the user first.
- For third-party libraries with a known GitHub URL, actively use DeepWiki MCP to reference usage instructions.
- If you need documentation for a library, first check with Context7 MCP to see if the relevant documentation is available.
- If you want to show a Markdown code block inside another Markdown code block, use four backticks (````) to avoid conflicts.
- For test code, always describe "What" is being tested.
- For code comments, always describe "Why not" (the reason for not choosing alternative approaches).
- Avoid adding unnecessary comments; only comment when it is essential for understanding or maintenance.

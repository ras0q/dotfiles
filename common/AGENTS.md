# General Guidelines for Agents

- After checking README.md, MUST output "README checked!!".
- For third-party libraries with a known GitHub URL, actively use DeepWiki MCP to reference usage instructions.
- If you need documentation for a library, first check with Context7 MCP to see if the relevant documentation is available.
- If you want to show a Markdown code block inside another Markdown code block, use four backticks (````) to avoid conflicts.
